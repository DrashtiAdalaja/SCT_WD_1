          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge and skills and the development 
            of character traits. Formal education occurs within a structured institutional framework, such as public
             schools, following a curriculum. Non-formal education also follows a structured approach but occurs outside
              the formal schooling system, while informal education involves unstructured learning through daily 
              experiences. Formal and non-formal education are categorized into levels, including early childhood 
              education, primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education.</p>

          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education can be characterized from both the teacher's and the 
            student's perspectives. Teacher-centered definitions emphasize the perspective and role of the teacher
             in transmitting knowledge and skills in a morally appropriate manner.On the other hand,
              student-centered definitions analyze education based on the student's involvement in the learning
               process, suggesting that this process transforms and enriches their subsequent experiences. It is 
               also possible to consider definitions that incorporate both perspectives. In this approach, education
                is seen as a process of shared experience, involving the discovery of a common world and the
                 collaborative solving of problems</p>

          <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">In primitive cultures, education predominantly occurred informally,
             with little distinction between educational activities and other daily endeavors. Instead, the entire 
             environment served as a classroom, and adults commonly assumed the role of educators. However, informal
              education often proves insufficient for imparting large quantities of knowledge. To address this
               limitation, formal educational settings and trained instructors are typically necessary. This
                necessity contributed to the increasing significance of formal education throughout history.
                 Over time, formal education led to a shift towards more abstract learning experiences and topics, 
                 distancing itself from daily life. </p>
